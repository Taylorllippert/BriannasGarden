# BriannasGarden
Game-styled app that incentivizes practicing reading/math
## Purpose
My target user is a young adult woman who has Autism. She has difficulty reading, recalling the names of numbers, and quantifing currency and time. Apps and games that focus on the academic skills she needs are aimed at young children, and are not interesting to her. 
The goal of this app/project is to give her the space to practice these skills without making her feel like she is playing a 'baby' game.

## Overview
The game will be a garden, the user must complete games to earn coins. The coins can be used to purchase flower seeds, fertelizer or other gardening items.
